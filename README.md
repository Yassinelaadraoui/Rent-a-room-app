<h1>Room renting website</h1>
<h6>School Project</h6>

This Website takes a similar approach to room renting as Airbnb with a different design, it targets students looking for a shared apartment, it allows the user to search and find available rooms in the area and contact the owner
my hope was to integrate a payment system with this website but i didn't get to finish it due to some school work. 
the website is responsive and has a mobile view as well

design using Angular, Bootstrap and html5/CSS3
